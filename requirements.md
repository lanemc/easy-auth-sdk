# Developer Experience-Focused Auth Integration Module – Product Requirements Document

## Overview and Vision

This project is a **developer-centric authentication integration module** – an NPM package that provides a seamless, secure, and easy-to-implement authentication solution. It is designed to simplify the integration of common auth mechanisms (NextAuth-compatible social logins, OAuth 2.0 providers, and traditional email/password) into web applications. The vision is to deliver an “**ezpz install**” authentication toolkit that dramatically reduces the effort and complexity of adding user authentication, while following best practices for security and user experience.

Key aspects of the solution include a fully integrated and customizable **login/signup UI** (built with modern **Shadcn UI components and Tailwind CSS**), out-of-the-box database integration (starting with PostgreSQL), and a simple yet powerful **SDK/API** for developers. The module is framework-agnostic at its core, with first-class integrations for popular frameworks like Next.js already built out. By focusing on developer experience (DX), this product aims to solve the pain points developers face with existing auth solutions – providing sensible defaults, minimal configuration, and extensibility without sacrificing security or flexibility.

## Problem Statement and Pain Points

Implementing authentication is a well-known challenge for developers. Despite being a common requirement, **authentication remains surprisingly complex to implement correctly**. There are several pain points that this product addresses:

- **High Implementation Complexity & Risk:** Building authentication from scratch is time-consuming and **risky**. Developers worry about making mistakes that could introduce security vulnerabilities. Ensuring password security, managing sessions, and keeping up with evolving best practices (OWASP guidelines, token handling, etc.) can be daunting. Rolling your own auth is described as _“expensive and dangerous”_ due to the potential for errors and maintenance overhead. This tool addresses this by providing battle-tested, secure auth flows out of the box, so developers don’t have to reinvent the wheel.

- **Multiple OAuth Providers are Hard to Integrate:** Supporting social logins (Google, GitHub, Facebook, etc.) means dealing with OAuth/OIDC flows for each provider, each with slightly different nuances and documentation. Integrating several providers can become **convoluted** and time-consuming, often requiring the developer to study lengthy docs for each one. Moreover, handling edge cases – for example, a single user signing in via multiple providers leading to duplicate accounts – requires custom logic in many systems. Our solution will streamline multi-provider support with a unified interface and built-in handling for linking accounts (e.g. same email from different providers maps to one user account by default) to eliminate that _“custom code”_ burden.

- **Pain Points in Existing Solutions:** Current open-source libraries and services have trade-offs that can hurt DX:

  - _NextAuth (Auth.js)_ offers flexibility and many providers, but can require significant configuration and has a learning curve. New developers have found its documentation lacking, leading to frustration when implementing anything beyond basic scenarios (like role-based access or custom user data) – these often demand extra callbacks and understanding of its internals. In short, _“extensive configuration overhead”_ can make NextAuth integration non-trivial.
  - _Managed services (Auth0, etc.)_ provide easy initial setup via dashboards, but come with **downsides**: vendor lock-in, high costs at scale, and limited flexibility for custom features unless you pay for enterprise tiers. They also often require using their hosted UIs or APIs, which might not blend well with a custom app’s stack. Developers seeking full control and on-premise hosting can’t easily customize beyond what the service allows.
  - Even with these solutions, missing features (like built-in 2FA, multi-tenancy, or advanced user management) often force developers to implement additional code or integrate yet more services. This patchwork approach is cumbersome.

- **Fragmented Developer Experience:** Many authentication solutions require jumping between **configuring backend logic, setting up database tables, and building frontend UI**. For example, a developer might use NextAuth for backend, but still have to design their own login form or use the default unstyled form and then style it. Similarly, using an OAuth provider requires creating client IDs/secrets and configuring callbacks in multiple places. These fragmented steps slow down development. We aim to unify this by providing a cohesive package: one install gives you the backend logic + a pre-built frontend component that is easily dropped into an app’s UI.

In summary, developers need a solution that **handles the heavy lifting of auth in a secure and opinionated way**, while still allowing flexibility. The solution should eliminate the common pain points (excessive boilerplate, config, piecemeal docs, and fear of security flaws) and replace them with a smooth, confidence-inspiring developer experience.

## Goals and Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- **Easy Integration, “EZPZ” Setup:** Provide a virtually plug-and-play module that developers can add to their project with minimal steps. Installing and configuring the auth module should be straightforward – e.g. install the NPM package, set a few environment variables (database URL, secrets, provider keys), and initialize the auth module in code. Sensible defaults should cover most use cases out of the box. The developer should be able to get a working auth system (with database persistence and a basic UI) running within minutes, not days.
- **Multiple Auth Methods, Unified API:** Support **email/password (credentials)** authentication (with secure password handling) as well as **OAuth/OIDC** providers (social login) under one roof. Developers can easily enable or disable auth methods via config (e.g. turn on Google and GitHub login by providing credentials, or disable social logins to use only email/password). All methods funnel through a single cohesive API/SDK, so usage (on both client and server) is consistent. This unified approach removes the need to juggle separate libraries for different auth methods.
- **NextAuth Compatibility & Migration:** Ensure that the module either integrates with or is at least compatible with NextAuth (Auth.js) conventions. Many projects use NextAuth; we want to make adoption of our module easy for those projects. For example, the database schema and session mechanism should not conflict with NextAuth’s – ideally we can **reuse or easily migrate the NextAuth database tables** so that switching over is low-friction. If a project already has NextAuth configured, our tool could either wrap around it (leveraging its providers internally) or provide a clear migration path (with scripts to port users/sessions). The goal is to leverage the familiarity of NextAuth’s model while offering a better DX on top of it.
- **Integrated UI (Powered by Shadcn UI & Tailwind):** Provide a **built-in, customizable UI** for user sign-up and login (including screens or components for login, registration, password reset, etc.). This UI should be modern and easily themeable, built using the [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com) component library and Tailwind CSS for styling consistency. By using Shadcn’s accessible, pre-built components and utility classes from Tailwind, the UI will be both polished and simple to restyle. Developers can drop this UI into their app (e.g. as a Next.js page or a modal component) and get a professional look by default. This saves developers from the pain of designing auth forms from scratch or wrestling with unstyled defaults. **No separate UI is needed for managing providers** (no admin dashboard for OAuth setup) – that complexity is handled via configuration code, keeping the module lightweight. The only provided UI is the end-user facing auth interface (login/sign-up forms).
- **Framework-Agnostic Core with First-Class Adapters:** Design the core library to be framework agnostic (runnable in a Node.js environment, or serverless functions) so it can theoretically work with Express, Next.js, SvelteKit, etc. On launch, provide **easy integration for popular frameworks** – e.g., a Next.js adapter that wraps the module into Next’s API Route or Route Handler format seamlessly. These integrations should feel idiomatic: for Next.js, perhaps an example of how to use the module in `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts` or via a custom handler that replaces NextAuth. For Express, maybe a simple middleware usage. The idea is to have **pre-built integration guides or small wrappers** so that using this in common environments requires little effort (most of the heavy lifting is abstracted in the SDK). The SDK itself should be **extensible**, allowing developers to customize flows or integrate with less common frameworks by writing minimal glue code.
- **Secure by Default:** Follow security best practices by default so developers don’t have to think about them. This includes hashing passwords with a strong algorithm (e.g. bcrypt or Argon2) with salts, using prepared statements or an ORM to avoid SQL injection, storing session tokens securely (HTTP-only cookies or signed JWTs with adequate entropy), and providing protections against common attacks (for instance, built-in support for email verification to prevent fake account spam, rate limiting hooks to throttle brute-force login attempts, etc.). The module should be built with compliance in mind (e.g. easily support GDPR requirements like user data deletion, and industry-standard practices like not storing plaintext sensitive data). Security should not be a pain point left to the developer – it’s a core goal that the library handles this reliably.
- **Developer Experience & Documentation:** Every aspect of this product should be geared towards an excellent developer experience:

  - **Automatic Database Setup:** The module will either automatically generate the needed database schema or provide a simple migration tool to set it up. For example, on initialization it can detect if the users table or other required tables are missing and create them (or provide SQL/Prisma/Drizzle definitions the developer can apply). This auto-configuration reduces setup steps dramatically.
  - **Clear Documentation & Examples:** Provide thorough documentation, including quick-start guides, code samples, and recipes for common customizations. Developers should have a clear path to implement typical needs (e.g. “How to add Google login”, “How to customize the UI theme”, “How to run in Next.js vs Express”). Good docs and maybe a demo repository will prevent the frustration developers voiced about poor docs in other tools.
  - **Sensible API Design:** The SDK should have intuitive methods (e.g. `auth.signIn(), auth.signOut(), auth.requireAuthMiddleware()` etc.) and configuration objects. Naming should be clear and consistent. TypeScript support is a must – the developer should get autocompletion and type checks for config options (for instance, when they configure providers or call an SDK function, types guide them). This reduces errors and makes integration almost self-documenting in code.
  - **Minimal Boilerplate:** The developer should not need to write glue code for common scenarios. For example, verifying a password and checking a user’s email on login will be handled internally – the developer doesn’t have to write SQL or calls to compare hashes. If using Next.js, we might supply a handler so the developer doesn’t even need to set up API routes manually, unless they want to customize them. This is about reducing the “cognitive load” and letting developers focus on their app’s unique logic rather than authentication plumbing.
  - **Customizability & Extensibility:** While defaults cover the basics, it should be easy to customize behavior. For instance, developers could plug in callbacks for events (on user signup, on login success/failure, etc.), or override certain flows (like providing a custom verification logic). They should also be able to style the frontend components to match their app (Tailwind design tokens, or replacing the component entirely with their own while still calling the SDK for logic). The system should be built on open standards (OAuth 2.0, OIDC, JWT) so that experienced developers can extend or replace parts if needed without being trapped in a black box.

**Non-Goals:**

- The module is **not a full-fledged user admin dashboard or identity provider SaaS**. We will not build features like a GUI to manage users, roles, or auth providers (as Auth0 or Firebase might offer) – those are beyond the scope of this developer-focused toolkit. Instead, our focus is providing the building blocks (APIs, UI components, database schema) so developers can integrate authentication into their own applications and admin panels. For example, managing OAuth client credentials or creating new roles are done via code or the developer’s own admin interface, not via a provided GUI. This keeps the module lightweight and flexible.
- We are not attempting to implement every possible auth feature in v1. Advanced features like multi-factor authentication (2FA), passwordless login, or multi-tenant organization management are desirable but are out-of-scope for the initial release. Our architecture, however, should be designed to accommodate these in the future via plugins or extensions. For instance, while v1 might not ship with 2FA, we plan to make the SDK extensible so that adding a 2FA module or plugin later will be straightforward (e.g. an optional plugin could add TOTP or SMS verification flows).
- The module will not bundle third-party communication services (no built-in email/SMS delivery service). For things like email verification or password reset emails, we will **not** hard-code integration with any specific email provider. Instead, the requirement is to clearly document **integration points** where the developer can plug in their preferred email/SMS service. For example, we might provide a callback or function stub like `onSendVerificationEmail(user, code)` that the developer can implement to call their email API of choice. This way, the SDK stays agnostic but makes it obvious how to connect those pieces – **“it should be clear where the developer needs to add in those connections”** for external services, so they can easily complete the flow with minimal code.

By clarifying these non-goals, we ensure we remain focused on the core deliverable: an easy-to-use auth integration tool, rather than a monolithic identity platform or a managed service.

## Product Features and Requirements

### 1. Supported Authentication Methods

**Email & Password Authentication:**
The module will support traditional **username/email and password** sign-up and login. Passwords must be stored securely in the database (hashed with a strong one-way algorithm and salted). We will use industry-standard hashing (e.g. bcrypt with a high work factor, or Argon2id) and never store plaintext passwords. The SDK will provide APIs to register a new user (with password) and to authenticate a user via password. This includes:

- **Sign-up flow:** Create a new user record with email and password. Optionally, support an email verification step – e.g., the SDK can generate a verification token and expose a callback to send it via email. If verification is enabled, new users would be marked unverified until they click the email link. (Email delivery is handled by the app via the integration point, as noted in Non-Goals.)
- **Login flow:** Verify credentials. The developer (or our UI component) will call an SDK method like `auth.loginWithCredentials(email, password)` which handles checking the DB for a user, verifying the hash, and returning a session token or establishing a session. Error cases (wrong password, user not found, not verified) should be communicated with proper error messages so the UI can display feedback.

By providing this out-of-the-box, we address the pain that _“email-password auth is a pain”_ to implement manually and get right. The SDK will make it a one-liner to enable email/password auth (e.g. an option in the config). In code configuration, it might look like:

```ts
authModule.setup({
  providers: {
    emailPassword: { enabled: true },
  },
  // ...other config...
});
```

This signals the module to allow email/pass sign-in, and the module ensures the necessary database tables (for users and credentials) are in place, hashing is configured, etc.

**OAuth Social Login (Third-Party Providers):**
The module will support popular OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect providers for social login, such as **Google, GitHub, Facebook, Twitter**, etc. Our strategy is to provide a set of pre-built provider configurations for the most common ones, so developers can enable them with minimal effort. For example, configuration might allow:

```ts
authModule.setup({
  providers: {
    google: {
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    },
    github: {
      clientId: process.env.GITHUB_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_SECRET,
    },
    // ...other providers...
  },
});
```

Each provider would have a predefined integration (authorization URL, token URL, user profile URL, scopes, etc.), so the developer only needs to supply credentials. The module handles the OAuth flow: redirecting to provider, receiving the callback, exchanging code for tokens, fetching the user profile, and creating or linking a local user account. By **unifying multiple providers under one SDK**, we eliminate the need to manually set up each one – which was cited as a major pain point where _“time is spent working out how to integrate with Facebook, Twitter, Github etc.”_.

**Account Linking:** A crucial requirement is how the module handles a single user using multiple providers (e.g. they signed up with email/password, later try “Login with Google” using the same email). By default, the module should detect this scenario (same verified email address from Google OAuth and an existing account) and **link the accounts** instead of creating a duplicate. We can do this by using email as a unique identifier (when available and verified). If a social provider returns an email that matches an existing user, we attach the new OAuth provider creds to that user’s account. This behavior addresses the annoyance noted by developers where multiple sign-in options can create duplicate accounts without custom code. We will make this the default, while allowing an override if a developer prefers separate accounts.

**NextAuth (Auth.js) Integration:**
For projects already using NextAuth or for those who want to leverage its ecosystem, our module will integrate smoothly. There are two approaches we consider:

- _Using the module alongside NextAuth:_ The module could act as **another provider** within NextAuth (for instance, handling credentials or custom logic), or our UI could call NextAuth’s endpoints. However, this approach could be clunky, effectively duplicating functionality.
- _Replacing NextAuth with our module while maintaining compatibility:_ We prefer making our solution a drop-in replacement for NextAuth in a Next.js context. That means providing a similar interface (session handling, client hooks) so that switching does not require a full rewrite. We will document how to swap NextAuth for our module in a Next.js app. Additionally, we plan to support **migrating NextAuth’s database**. Since NextAuth (Auth.js) often uses a certain schema for users/accounts/sessions, we will offer migration scripts or compatibility modes. For example, our database schema can be based on Auth.js defaults (user table, accounts table for OAuth, session table) so that we can literally use an existing NextAuth database with minimal changes. Migration tools will help port data if needed (e.g., hashing algorithms differences or adding missing columns). This compatibility ensures that adopting our module is not an “all or nothing” risky move – developers can transition gradually, confident that their existing user base can be retained.

**Other Authentication Modes (Future):**
While not in the initial scope, the architecture should not preclude adding modes like:

- Passwordless login (magic email links or OTP codes)
- Multi-factor (TOTP apps or SMS codes as a second step)
- SAML/SSO for enterprise (less common for developer-focused projects, but possible later)

These won’t be implemented in v1, but we note them as future enhancements. The plugin architecture (see Extensibility below) should allow adding these without core redesign.

### 2. Developer Experience & SDK Design

The success of this module hinges on superb **developer experience (DX)**. Requirements in this area include:

- **Simple Installation and Setup:** Getting started should require only a few steps. For example:

  1. `npm install auth-module` (package name TBD).
  2. Add an initialization snippet in the application (for Next.js, this could be in an API route or middleware; for Express, an app.use). This snippet involves providing a config object with at least a database connection and a session secret.
  3. Include the provided `<AuthUI />` component (our login UI) in the appropriate place (e.g., a dedicated `/login` page or as a component that can show a login modal).

  That’s it – the basics should be working with those minimal steps. **“Sensible defaults”** mean if the developer doesn’t configure something, the module assumes a safe default (for instance, if no custom JWT secret provided, it can throw an error to remind or generate one in development; if no redirect URLs are set for OAuth, it uses the current site URL, etc.). This approach is inspired by Better Auth’s emphasis on _simple config with sensible defaults_, aiming to have **lower setup complexity** than NextAuth’s more manual configuration.

- **Code-Driven Configuration (No Provider UI):** All configuration for auth providers and options will be done in code (or environment variables), not via a separate admin GUI. This is intentional to keep developers in their flow – configuration is part of the codebase (and can be source-controlled). For example, adding a new OAuth provider is as easy as adding a few lines in the config and redeploying, rather than clicking around a dashboard. This also means the build pipeline can handle different configs per environment (dev, staging, prod via env vars). The lack of a GUI for config is not a limitation but a DX choice, since an **“intuitive SDK API”** is provided for all these settings. We ensure the config structure is well-documented and perhaps even **typed** (so IDEs will auto-complete provider names, etc., reducing mistakes).

- **SDK Methods and Developer API:** The module exposes an API (likely as an imported object or set of functions). Key methods might include:

  - `auth.register(credentials)` – create a new user (if using email/password).
  - `auth.login(credentials)` – authenticate and start a session (returns a token or sets cookie).
  - `auth.socialRedirect(provider)` – get a URL to redirect the user to (for OAuth flow start).
  - `auth.socialCallback(provider, query)` – process the OAuth callback (exchange code for token and login the user).
  - `auth.logout()` – invalidate session.
  - `auth.getSession(request)` – retrieve current session/user info from a request (for protecting routes).
  - Utility methods like `auth.requireAuth(handler)` to wrap Next.js/Express handlers to enforce login.

  The exact API will be refined, but the guiding principle is **clarity and completeness** – everything developers commonly need to do with auth can be done via the SDK. They should rarely, if ever, need to drop down to writing SQL queries or manual cookie parsing. When they do need to extend, the SDK should provide hooks (see _Extensibility_). The API should also handle underlying complexity (like rotating refresh tokens, etc.) internally.

- **TypeScript Support:** The module will be written in TypeScript, exposing types for User, Session, etc. This gives developers compile-time assurances. For instance, if a developer configures an OAuth provider, the config function might enforce presence of `clientId` and `clientSecret` fields. Also, when using the auth UI component, props can be strongly typed (e.g. a prop to toggle dark mode styling could be an enum). The focus on TS echoes Better Auth’s approach of being _“designed from the ground up for TypeScript with a focus on developer experience”_. In practical terms, this means fewer runtime errors and more IntelliSense help in IDEs, contributing to a smooth DX.

- **Logging and Error Handling:** The SDK should include helpful logging (especially in development mode) to guide developers. For example, if a configuration is missing (say Google clientSecret not set), an error message should clearly explain the issue and perhaps link to docs. If an OAuth callback fails, logs should show the reason (e.g. token exchange failed). We will avoid silent failures. Additionally, errors returned to the UI (like "Invalid password") should be safe and not leak sensitive info. A configurable debug mode could be available for deeper troubleshooting. Good error messages and logging are part of DX – they prevent hours of guessing and frustration.

- **CLI Utilities (Optional):** As a stretch goal, we might include a CLI for certain tasks to improve DX. For example, a CLI command to bootstrap the auth module into a project (scaffold config file, env examples, etc.), or to run database migrations if we ship SQL files. This is not strictly required, but could be a nice addition to reduce manual steps for the developer. If not a CLI, at least clear instructions for any setup (like SQL migration commands) are required.

### 3. Database Integration and Management

**Primary Database Support – PostgreSQL:**
The initial version will support **PostgreSQL** as the database for storing user credentials, accounts, sessions, etc. The decision to start with Postgres is due to its popularity and reliability in the developer community, and its robust feature set for transactional integrity. Our module should handle Postgres integration seamlessly by allowing the developer to provide a connection (e.g., a connection string or pool). For instance, configuration might look like:

```ts
authModule.setup({
  database: {
    type: "postgres",
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL, // e.g. postgres://user:pass@host/db
  },
});
```

Under the hood, we can use an **ORM or query builder** for portability. A strong candidate is \[Drizzle ORM or Prisma], since these can define schema models in TypeScript and work with Postgres (and other DBs eventually). Drizzle, in particular, is lightweight and **can auto-generate schema** for us. We saw in the community that auto generating tables for users and sessions was praised as part of a great DX (“auto generated my drizzle schemas for users, sessions etc, full type safe and dead simple api”). We want to provide a similar experience.

**Schema and Migrations:**
Out of the box, the module should ensure that the necessary tables/collections exist. A possible approach:

- Provide a default schema for:

  - **Users** – storing basic profile info (id, email, password hash (if using credentials), possibly name, etc., plus timestamps).
  - **Accounts/Providers** – storing OAuth accounts linked to users (fields for provider name, provider account ID, userId link, access token, refresh token if applicable, etc.).
  - **Sessions** – if we use persistent sessions (for session tokens or cookies, unless purely JWT stateless).
  - Optionally, **VerificationTokens** – for email verification or password reset flows (token, user link, expiration).

- When the module initializes, if it can detect the absence of these tables (depending on permissions), it could either auto-create them or throw a descriptive error instructing the developer to run a migration. To keep things simple, we may include a utility like `authModule.generateSchema()` that outputs the SQL or migration file needed, which the developer can run. For example, if using Prisma, we could provide a Prisma schema snippet to merge into their schema. If using Drizzle, perhaps run Drizzle’s migration automatically. The approach will consider the developer’s control – we likely will not auto-migrate in production without explicit consent, but we want to make the setup as easy as running one command.
- All database interactions (reads/writes for auth) are handled internally by the module via an abstraction (ORM or queries). The developer should not have to manually write queries for any auth-related task.

**Data Model Considerations:**

- Use **UUIDs or ULIDs** for primary keys for users (to avoid predictable IDs).
- Store minimal PII in the auth schema – essentially just what’s needed for authentication. Additional user profile data (address, etc.) might live in application-specific tables managed by the developer; our user table can be extended or linked as needed. We should allow adding fields easily (for instance, a JSONB metadata column for user profile could be part of default schema to store misc. info).
- Ensure **referential integrity** (foreign keys between accounts and users, etc.) so data doesn’t orphan.
- If sessions are stored, have an index on expiration for cleanup. Possibly provide a cleanup function to purge expired sessions periodically.

**Performance and Connection Management:**

- Use connection pooling for efficiency (Postgres `Pool` if using node-postgres). The developer can either pass an existing pool or we instantiate one from the connection string.
- Queries should be optimized (proper indices on user email, etc., for fast lookup). This is especially important for login flows (checking email unique, validating password).
- For scalability, design so that heavy operations (like password hash computation) are done asynchronously and won’t block the event loop excessively (maybe allow opting into using worker threads for hashing if needed, or just rely on Node’s async bcrypt library internals).
- The module should be able to handle a reasonable scale of users – e.g., tens or hundreds of thousands of users – without redesign. Postgres can handle this on decent hardware; our queries and indexes should allow linear scaling. In the future, if supporting other databases, we will ensure similarly robust performance expectations for those.

**Future Database Support:**
While Postgres is the first target, the design should not make it impossible to support others (MySQL/MariaDB, SQLite for dev, Mongo or others via separate adapters). By using an abstraction like an ORM or by isolating SQL in one module, we can later introduce additional adapters. The **framework-agnostic** goal extends here: e.g., a Next.js app might use Planetscale (MySQL) – we may later offer compatibility. But to keep scope in check, we start with Postgres and treat others as future enhancements once core is stable.

### 4. Session Management and Security

**Session Strategy:**
Our auth module will manage user sessions after successful login. There are a couple of patterns:

- **HTTP-only Cookie Session (with database store):** We can issue a session identifier (random token or JWT) that is set as an HTTP-only cookie in the user’s browser. On the server side, we store session records in the database linking the token to the user (and perhaps a last seen timestamp and expiration). This is similar to NextAuth’s database session strategy and is straightforward: it allows server-side verification of sessions and easy invalidation (delete the session row to log someone out).
- **Stateless JWT:** Alternatively, we could issue a JWT (signed with `AUTH_SECRET`) that contains user info. This would be stored in a cookie or returned to client. Stateless JWTs ease scaling (no DB lookup for each request if the JWT is self-contained) but complicate logout (can’t easily revoke a token until it expires unless maintaining a blacklist).

For developer-friendliness and initial simplicity, we lean towards **stateful sessions with cookies** stored in Postgres. This aligns with our focus on Postgres and also is very secure (tokens are random and only stored server-side, reducing JWT-related risks). It’s noted that NextAuth supports both JWT and DB sessions; our approach can similarly offer both. Perhaps default to DB sessions, with an option to switch to JWT if the developer prefers stateless. The default expiration for sessions might be configurable (e.g. 30 days idle timeout, etc.) and we should allow “remember me” functionality (longer lived cookie) vs short session.

**Secure Cookie Settings:**
Any cookies used for auth (session cookie, CSRF token if any) should be HttpOnly and Secure (only sent over HTTPS), with SameSite=Lax or Strict to mitigate CSRF. If our module handles setting cookies (likely in Next.js adapter or Express middleware), we ensure these flags are set correctly. We will also support an environment where the front-end and back-end are on different domains (setting appropriate SameSite=None and CORS), though the primary scenario is a same-site Next app.

**Password Security:**
As mentioned, passwords are hashed (using bcrypt/Argon2). We’ll use a strong default (e.g. bcrypt with cost 12) and allow configuration if needed (to increase cost or switch algorithm). The module should also implement **basic brute-force protection** – e.g., if there are many failed login attempts for a user, temporarily lock that user or slow responses (to mitigate password guessing). This might be as simple as a counter in memory or DB and a short lockout. We will document this behavior and allow developers to adjust thresholds.

**OAuth Security:**
When integrating OAuth providers, follow the best practices: use PKCE for code flows where applicable, validate state parameter on callback (to prevent CSRF), and verify the OAuth provider’s ID token (for OIDC providers like Google we verify JWT signature, etc.). The module should handle these details internally so the developer doesn’t need to worry about them. We’ll also store minimal tokens – e.g., store refresh tokens securely encrypted if needed, or avoid storing access tokens unless necessary (maybe just fetch profile and discard, since we only need to maintain an identity, not continually use the third-party API unless the app requires it).

**Encryption of Sensitive Data:**
Consider encrypting certain sensitive fields at rest (beyond password which is hashed). For example, if we store OAuth access/refresh tokens (which might be needed if the app later wants to use them to call the provider’s API), those could be encrypted with a key. Alternatively, we encourage apps to fetch whatever minimal profile info needed at login and not store long-lived tokens to reduce risk.

**Compliance and Auditing:**
The design should facilitate compliance:

- For GDPR, being able to delete a user and all associated auth data easily. Our module should provide a method to remove a user (which would cascade delete their accounts, sessions).
- We should log important security events (possibly offering hooks for the developer to log or act on them): e.g., login success, login failure, password change, etc. These could be printed in dev, and in production the developer can tie into their logging system. This helps with audit trails.
- If applicable, ensure that adding features like TOTP 2FA will be possible (e.g., our user table can accommodate a field for 2FA secret or recovery codes if the plugin is added).

In essence, **security is a first-class requirement** woven through all features – we recognize that developers choose solutions they trust to be secure, as one of the biggest pain points is constantly worrying _“you made a mistake… your authentication is not fully secure”_. By adhering to frameworks like OWASP ASVS for authentication, we aim to remove that anxiety for our users (the developers).

### 5. Integrated User Interface (UI)

A standout feature of this module is the built-in **authentication UI** that comes with it, emphasizing both ease of use and modern design:

- **Shadcn UI + Tailwind for Design:** We have chosen Shadcn UI components and Tailwind CSS as the foundation for the auth UI. Shadcn UI (a collection of accessible React components styled with Tailwind) allows us to build a cohesive interface quickly. Using these ensures the UI is consistent with modern app aesthetics and is fully accessible (keyboard navigation, screen reader friendly). Tailwind utility classes make it easy for developers to customize the styling if desired by overriding classes or applying themes. For instance, the login form might use Shadcn’s `<Input>` and `<Button>` components with our default styles, but a developer could extend the Tailwind config (or supply className props) to change colors, spacing, etc., without writing custom CSS from scratch. The decision to use this stack is informed by community feedback where pairing a good auth library with tools like Shadcn UI was praised for DX (“works so nice with ... @shadcn ui”).

- **Pre-built Components/Pages:** The module will ship with pre-made React components (and potentially pre-styled pages for Next.js). Examples include:

  - `<AuthLoginPage />`: a component that renders a complete login form (with email/password fields, or social login buttons, depending on enabled methods). It handles state and calls the SDK on submit.
  - `<AuthRegisterPage />`: form for sign-up (if using email signup).
  - `<AuthProviderButton provider="google" />`: maybe smaller components for individual provider login buttons, in case a developer wants to customize layout.
  - `<AuthPasswordReset />`: if we include password reset flow, a component for requesting reset and entering new password.

  If using Next.js App Router, these could be provided as a set of components to use in a page. If using Next.js Pages Router or another framework, developers can choose to use our components in their own pages or even use our provided pages directly (perhaps via a router config). Flexibility here is key: a quick option is an auto-generated set of routes, but that might conflict, so likely we supply components and the developer adds them to routes as needed.

- **Customizability:** While the default UI should be attractive and usable, we expect many developers will want to match their app’s branding. Thus, our UI should allow customization in a few ways:

  - **Theming:** Because it’s Tailwind-based, if the developer has a Tailwind theme (colors, fonts), our components should inherit those by default. For example, if their Tailwind config sets a primary color, our buttons could use that. We may provide a light and dark mode out of the box (Shadcn’s components typically support dark mode easily).
  - **Composable/Headless Option:** Some might want to use the logic but completely custom UI. We can accommodate this by separating the core logic from UI. For instance, the SDK can expose hooks like `useAuth()` that provide state and methods (similar to React context for auth). Then developers could build their own forms but call `auth.login()` from their custom form handler. In other words, the UI is optional – developers can bypass it and implement from scratch if they prefer, using our logic. However, providing a high-quality default reduces the need for that in most cases.
  - **Content and Localization:** Allow customizing text labels, error messages, etc., for i18n support. Perhaps our components accept a dictionary of labels or support a context for localization.
  - **Hide/Show Features:** If a site only uses one method (say only Google login), the UI should be smart or configurable to not show irrelevant options. Developers can configure which options to display (matching what’s enabled in backend).

- **No External Dependencies for UI (except CSS/JS):** The UI should work without requiring the developer to include heavy libraries. Shadcn UI itself is basically a set of React components using Radix under the hood, and we assume the app will already have Tailwind CSS set up (if not, we might need to document adding it, or we package styles appropriately). We want to avoid forcing a specific CSS-in-JS or something – Tailwind is widely adopted and can be integrated via PostCSS build. If needed, we can also provide a pre-compiled CSS file for our styles for non-Tailwind users, but since we specifically list Tailwind as a tech, likely we assume its presence or encourage it.

- **Responsive & Accessible:** The UI must be mobile-friendly (responsive design that works on small screens) and accessible (proper ARIA labels, focus management especially for modals, color contrast meeting AA guidelines, etc.). Using Shadcn (which is built on Radix UI) gives us a good starting point, as Radix components come with accessibility considerations built-in.

- **Example UI Screenshot (for docs):** We should include in documentation a screenshot of the default login screen to show developers what they get out of the box – likely a modern looking form with a title, inputs, and some provider buttons. (In our PRD context, we might imagine it, but when building we’d actually craft it). This goes a long way to “sell” the DX: a dev knows if they use the module, they don’t have to worry about designing these screens unless they want to.

In summary, the integrated UI addresses the often tedious task of building auth forms, giving developers a **plug-and-play UI** that is good by default and easy to tweak. This aligns with the product’s goal of being **“so easy to implement”** that even the frontend part is mostly taken care of.

### 6. Framework Agnosticism and Integration Adapters

While the core logic of the module will be independent of any specific web framework, we will deliver targeted integration packages or guides for the most common use cases to ensure a smooth experience:

- **Next.js Integration:** Since Next.js (especially with the App Router in Next 13+ and beyond) is extremely popular, we will provide a clear integration strategy:

  - Possibly a Next.js-specific sub-package or instructions to use the core SDK in Next API routes. For example, we might export a Next.js route handler: `export const { GET, POST } = authModule.nextAuthHandler()` which can be used in a file under `app/api/auth/[...].ts` to handle all auth-related routes (mimicking NextAuth’s catch-all route). This handler would internally call our core logic for different actions (sign-in, callback, etc.) based on the request.
  - Middleware: Next.js middleware can protect routes. We can document how to use `auth.getSession()` in a middleware function to redirect unauthenticated users to login.
  - Next.js UI usage: Provide an example of adding our `<AuthLoginPage />` component in a Next page, or even a ready-made page that can be imported or generated.

  The goal is that Next.js developers have almost a drop-in replacement for NextAuth, benefiting from our improvements. In fact, since Auth.js (NextAuth v5) is now itself more framework-agnostic, our library might conceptually play a similar role – but with a tighter integration and better DX. We can cite that Auth.js supports many frameworks now, and we want our module to be just as flexible, if not more.

- **Express (Node.js) Integration:** Provide a simple way to use in an Express app (or any Connect-style middleware system). For example:

  ```ts
  const app = express();
  app.use(sessionMiddleware()); // maybe if not using cookies by default
  app.use(authModule.expressMiddleware());
  ```

  The `expressMiddleware()` could mount routes (like `/auth/login`, `/auth/callback/:provider`, etc.) or allow the developer to mount them on a sub-path. This would parse requests, call our SDK, and send responses (possibly JSON for API responses, or redirects for OAuth flows). We need to document what endpoints and methods are handled so developers don’t accidentally conflict. Alternatively, we simply provide express handlers that they can plug in: e.g. `app.get('/auth/login', authModule.handlers.renderLoginPage)` and so on, giving more control.

- **Other Frameworks:** While we may not provide official packages for all, we can include in docs how to use core in other environments:

  - **React (non-Next)**: Using the Auth UI components in a CRA or Vite app, and calling the auth API via fetch/Axios to a Node backend.
  - **SvelteKit, Remix, Nuxt (Node backend frameworks)**: They could also call our core functions in their route handlers. Possibly we or the community can make small wrappers for these. The key is the core is decoupled enough to be called imperatively.

- **API-first usage:** Some developers might want to use the module purely as an API (for SPAs or mobile backends). We should support that by providing a clear REST or RPC interface for all actions. Essentially, every auth action can be invoked via an HTTP request (which our internal handlers already do). We will document the endpoints and request/response formats if one doesn’t use the provided frontend. This also implies CORS considerations for cross-origin use (we might allow configuration of allowed origins if used headlessly as an API server).

- **Cloud Functions / Edge Compatibility:** Ensure that the module does not rely on stateful in-memory sessions (beyond caches) so it can run in serverless environments (like Vercel Functions, AWS Lambda, etc.). Using the DB for session storage helps with this. We should also avoid heavy startup times or large dependencies to suit serverless cold starts. If possible, also allow running on edge (which implies no Node-specific APIs that can’t run in Cloudflare Workers – that might be a stretch if using Node crypto for bcrypt, but edge might not support that; however, one could offload auth to a server function if needed).

In short, **framework agnostic core** means the logic is in plain TypeScript functions that can be wired up anywhere, and **integration packages** will make it _already wired_ for popular frameworks. This fulfills the requirement that it’s generally agnostic but with **“easy implementations for popular tools like Next”** readily available, and an SDK flexible enough to integrate into others with minor effort.

### 7. Extensibility and Custom Hooks

To serve both simple and advanced needs, the module must be extensible. Requirements here:

- **Hook/Callback System:** Provide well-defined hook points where developers can inject custom logic. This includes:

  - _Post-signup hook:_ called after a new user registers (useful for sending welcome emails or populating additional profile info).
  - _Post-login hook:_ called after successful login (useful for logging analytics, or denying login based on custom conditions – e.g., user banned).
  - _Pre-password-hash hook:_ (perhaps to allow custom hashing or to enforce password policies before saving).
  - _Pre-OAuth-complete hook:_ (to inspect or transform data from provider before creating account – e.g., assign a role if email domain is company).

  These hooks could be configured in the setup, similar to NextAuth’s callbacks model but ideally simpler to use. They should be type-safe and documented. Hooks allow customizing behaviors without forking the library.

- **Plugin Architecture:** As mentioned, future features like 2FA, organization accounts, etc., could be added as plugins. We should design the core in a modular way (for example, the core could expose a method to register a plugin which can extend the schema and add routes or hooks). In v1, we might not implement actual plugins, but we can structure the code anticipating them. Better Auth uses a plugin system for things like twoFactor and organization support; our design should allow similar extensions. This means keeping core auth flows loosely coupled so additional checks (like a 2FA verification step) can be inserted, and additional data models (like org membership) can link to users.

- **Custom Providers:** While we will ship with common OAuth providers, developers may need to integrate an uncommon OAuth2 provider or an internal SSO. We should allow **custom OAuth provider configuration**. This could be an API where they provide the authorization, token, and userinfo URLs and a mapping function to our user profile schema. With that, our existing OAuth flow handler can be reused for the custom provider. This is important to not lock the module to only our predefined list.

- **UI Extensibility:** If using our UI, allow insertion of custom elements or additional fields. For example, maybe a developer wants to collect a username or accept terms at sign-up – we could allow the `<AuthRegisterPage>` to accept extra form fields or render children. Alternatively, as mentioned, one can bypass and use custom forms with the SDK if something truly custom is needed.

- **Internationalization (i18n):** For global apps, the module should be adaptable to multiple languages. Perhaps not built-in for v1, but we can ensure that all user-facing strings are centralizable for easy translation. Maybe as a simple JSON of strings that can be overridden in config.

The overarching requirement is that while the module provides a lot out-of-the-box, it should not be a dead end for unique requirements. Developers should feel that they can extend or customize it to fit their app, which increases adoption. As one developer in the community noted about Better Auth, it aimed to provide “everything you need for authentication without requiring extensive additional code” – our product should strive for that balance: comprehensive yet not restrictive.

## Technical Architecture

**High-Level Architecture:**
The module will likely have a few distinct parts:

- **Core Auth Engine:** The heart of the authentication logic – validating credentials, orchestrating OAuth flows, managing sessions, reading/writing the database. This will be written in TypeScript and not assume any specific web framework (it will accept inputs like a credential object or an OAuth callback payload, and return outputs like user info or session tokens). It can be stateless in logic (except for DB access). This core might be further divided into sub-modules (e.g., `PasswordAuth`, `OAuthManager`, `SessionManager`, `UserRepository` etc., for clarity and single responsibility).
- **Database Layer:** An abstraction or set of functions for all DB operations needed (find user by email, create user, update session, etc.). This can be implemented via an ORM or raw SQL. We should keep it replaceable if someone wants to use a different database in the future. Possibly define interfaces (TypeScript types) for a minimal “UserStore” and “SessionStore” that could have alternate implementations (like an in-memory one for testing, or a different database).
- **Integration Layer (Adapters):** Code that connects the core engine to specific environments:

  - For Next.js: an adapter that maps Next.js requests/responses to calls into the core, and vice versa for responses. Could leverage Next’s special behaviors (like using cookies in API routes, etc.). Also React components for the UI (since Next uses React).
  - For Express: middleware that does similar mapping.
  - Possibly separate package names, e.g. `auth-module-core`, `auth-module-next`, `auth-module-react-ui` etc., to allow tree-shaking if someone only needs core without React.

- **Frontend UI Components:** Built likely in React (for Next.js usage). If targeting other frontends, we might later create similar components for, say, Vue or Angular, but initially React covers a large swath of our target audience (Next.js, React SPAs). These components will internally call the core (probably via context or direct SDK calls) and handle UX state (loading, errors).
- **Configuration & Initialization:** A single point where the developer provides config (perhaps a function `initializeAuth(config)` that sets up global settings). This config is then used by both the core and integration layers to know what to do (which providers enabled, secrets, etc.).

**Request Flow Example (Credential Login in Next.js):**

1. User navigates to `/login` page in a Next.js app. The page renders `<AuthLoginPage />` from our UI library.
2. User enters email/password and hits submit. Our component calls `auth.login(email, password)` (from the SDK).
3. Inside, this might either call a Next.js API route (if the architecture is such that actual auth occurs server-side) or directly call core logic (if we allow direct usage). Likely, for security, the form submission should go to an API route (to avoid exposing secrets in client JS). So, `<AuthLoginPage>` could do a `fetch('/api/auth/login', { email, pass })` under the hood (or developer sets it up). That API route is handled by our Next.js adapter, which calls `AuthEngine.login(email, pass)`.
4. The core AuthEngine verifies the password via the DB. If valid, it creates a session entry and returns a session token.
5. Next.js adapter sets the cookie with session token and returns a response (maybe redirects or JSON).
6. The front-end component, seeing success, can redirect the user to the post-login page (or the API could have responded with a redirect).
7. Now, for any protected page, the developer can use our `auth.getSession()` in `getServerSideProps` or a route middleware to check auth. The session token in cookie is verified by looking up the session in DB (and optionally matching a hashed token for security).
8. User is allowed or redirected accordingly.

**OAuth Flow Example (Google login):**

1. User clicks “Sign in with Google” button (our `<AuthProviderButton provider="google" />`).
2. The front-end hits our Next API route `/api/auth/oauth/google` (for instance). The adapter constructs the Google authorization URL with proper query params (client ID, redirect URI, scopes, state) and responds with a redirect to Google.
3. User authorizes on Google and is redirected back to our callback endpoint (e.g. `/api/auth/oauth/google/callback?code=...&state=...`).
4. The Next.js adapter handling the callback validates the state and calls core `AuthEngine.handleOAuthCallback('google', code)` which:

   - Exchanges code for tokens via Google’s token URL.
   - Retrieves the user profile from Google’s API.
   - Finds or creates a user in our DB (if email exists, link; if new, create new user record and associated Google account record).
   - Creates a session for that user.

5. The adapter then sets session cookie, and redirects the user to the intended page (or returns success).
6. The user is now logged in via Google, with a local session.

This architecture ensures a clear separation: **Core logic vs. Adapter vs. UI.** Each piece can be modified or replaced (for example, a different UI, or a new adapter for another environment) without altering the others. This aligns with our framework agnostic and extensibility goals.

**Tech Stack Recap:**

- Language: TypeScript (for both server and React code).
- Node version: Should support LTS (which by 2025 might be Node 18 or 20).
- Database: PostgreSQL (via an ORM like Drizzle or Prisma, or direct SQL using node-postgres).
- Frontend: React + TailwindCSS (for default UI components).
- Dependencies:

  - Possibly `node-postgres` for direct DB access (or Prisma client which wraps pg).
  - `bcrypt` or `argon2` for hashing.
  - `oauth` libraries or we implement small calls (could use Axios or fetch for token exchange).
  - `jsonwebtoken` if JWT sessions are enabled.
  - Radix UI (as part of Shadcn components) and Tailwind (as peer dependency or expectation).
  - We will try to keep dependency count minimal to avoid bloat.

**Scalability & Performance Considerations:**

- The module should scale with typical horizontally scaled setups. Using the database for sessions means any server instance can authenticate requests by querying the shared DB. This is simpler than in-memory session stores which wouldn't work with multiple instances.
- We should document and design for caching where appropriate (for example, if a user’s session is checked on every request, perhaps allow caching the session lookup in memory for a short time or using a shared cache like Redis for performance, though that’s optional).
- We will test the module under load to ensure, for instance, the login route can handle concurrent requests and the DB queries are efficient. Proper indexing (on email for login, on session token) is crucial.
- Ensure that long-running operations (like sending an email or calling an OAuth provider) are handled asynchronously so they don't block the main thread (in Node, external calls are anyway async by nature). But we might provide feedback or loading states in UI accordingly.

## Conclusion and Future Work

This PRD outlines a comprehensive plan for a **developer-experience-focused auth integration module** that emphasizes easy setup, flexibility, and modern best practices. By addressing the common pain points – from reducing config complexity, to handling multi-provider quirks automatically, to providing a beautiful default UI – this solution aims to **empower developers** to add authentication to their apps with confidence and speed. The focus on Postgres ensures reliability in data management from day one, and the use of popular tools like Next.js and Tailwind means the module fits naturally into the workflows many developers already have.

**Success Criteria:** We will know this product succeeds if a developer can go from zero to a fully functioning auth system (with a user able to register, log in via password or Google, and have a session) in just a short session of work – essentially if we can cut down what used to be days of effort into an hour or two, with most of that time spent reading our docs or tweaking the UI to their liking. Feedback such as _“This has been the best auth experience by a mile, full type safe and dead simple API”_ is what we strive for.

**Future Directions:** After the core module is delivered, future versions can expand with features like:

- Built-in 2FA (TOTP integration as a plugin, additional UI for OTP setup/verification).
- Social providers beyond OAuth – e.g., Apple Sign-in which has some custom steps, or supporting SAML for enterprise logins.
- Deeper admin tools (maybe a simple CLI to list or manage users for admins).
- Support for additional databases or even a cloud-hosted option for those who want it (though our main value is self-hosted).
- Community contributions: making it open-source could allow the community to add adapters for more frameworks, more provider configs, etc., increasing its value.

By focusing on developer needs and keeping the solution extensible, we position this module to become a go-to choice for auth in new projects – especially for those who found existing solutions inadequate. Ultimately, this product should significantly reduce the friction of implementing authentication, letting developers concentrate on their core product features while we handle the auth heavy lifting securely and elegantly.
